Build a multi-vendor e-commerce application inspired by Shopee.

### 1. Product vision & goals

We want a marketplace where many independent sellers can list products and buyers can easily discover, compare, and purchase them in a safe and convenient way.  

Primary goals:

- Make it simple for small and medium merchants to open a shop, upload products, manage inventory, and handle orders.
- Build trust with ratings, reviews, clear shipping information, and buyer protection.
- Support growth-oriented features like vouchers, free-shipping campaigns, flash sales, and recommendation sections.

The first target market is Vietnam, mobile-first experience (iOS, Android, and responsive web), with a single currency (VND) in the first version.
